# My Blog-App

>A blog website is exemplified by the blog app. I designed a completely working website that will display a list of posts and allow viewers to engage with them by leaving comments and like posts.

## Prerequisites

- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

- Run git clone on this project at the desired directory:
  ```
  git clone  `git@github.com:Alfredbis29/My-Blog-App.git`
  ```
- Go to the cloned directory with `cd rails-blog-app`
- Install the required dependecies with `bundle install`
- Install npm dependencies with `npm install`
- With Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL installed in your environment, you can run `rails s` to see the website

## Tests

- To run the tests you must first have run `bundle install`
- Then in the repository's main directory run `bundle exec rspec spec`
